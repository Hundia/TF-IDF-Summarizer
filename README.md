About
----- 
A new measure for summarizing text using its TF-IDF original vectors was researched during a text mining seminar by Me (Eli Hundia)
and was developed me and Roman Nudleman as a coding project.
The paper can be found at the following link:

Introduction
------------
Understanding the TF-IDF measure behavior over the large corpuses of data, can provide a great deal of optimization for large data 
processing. 
representing a large corpus as its own summarization can mean a great deal in the field of data mining and decrease the processing 
time for algorithms who rely on TF-IDF measurements.

Prerequisites
-------------
Apart from the obvios nltk modules requirements, inorder to run the program you must first install the data from
the http://www.nltk.org/data.html

Expiriment
----------
The experiment benchmarks the performance of the weighting formula using different number of lines in the summary and all combinations 
of A's and B's while A + B = 1. For example, Given an A = 0.1, and B = 0.9, we documented results for lines ranging from 5 to 100.
